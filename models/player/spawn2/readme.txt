Model Name              : Hellspawn
Author                  : Demon Princess
Email Address           : torquebimini@hotmail.com

Model description       : It's Spawn! You do know Spawn, right? This is only my second model,
			  so don't kill me yet. :)

Other info		: Yes, I'm aware of the fact that there already is a Spawn model for
			  Q3:A. I'm also aware of the fact that it was done by someone with
			  a LOT more modelling experience than I have. Still, I wanted to do
			  my own. Well, I'm a psycho Spawn fan, ok?

			  This model also comes with a Redeemer skin, so you can
			  have the forces of Heaven fight against the forces of Hell. Now
			  isn't that nice? ;)

			  Some concessions had to be done though regarding the design of the
			  suit to keep the poly count down and to make it suitable for both
			  a Spawn and a Redeemer skin. For instance, I left out the chain around
			  his right arm, because modelling it took too many polygons and just
			  skinning it looked flat and crappy compared to his other chains.

Additional Credits to   : id Software for making a great game and Todd McFarlane for his Spawn
			  character!

Thanks to               : Nuclear Tes for testing and the people at the Polycount messageboard
			  for helping me out on the LODs!
