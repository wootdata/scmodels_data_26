Technical info:
  Poly count:  688 triangles
  Skins:  256x256 for the body and head
          64x64 chromed for the halo

Software used:
  Photoshop 5.0.2 to make the skin
  Milkshape 3D v1.0D for the modeling
  MdlViewer v2.1 for preliminary viewing and testing
  Half-Life, of course, for final checks

Notes:
  With the end of the millenium coming up (well, actually the new milennium doesn't
  start until 2001, but as Mulder told Scully, "Nobody likes a math nerd.")
  and the distinct possiblity of armageddon, don't you think it's time for the
  Second Coming of Christ?

  Anyways, I decided to keep it in as good taste as possible (I mean, hey, I like
  Jesus, he's a cool guy.) so He isn't bleeding, stripped naked, or wearing a
  crown of thorns.  He's here in his divine glory, fully man and fully God, in 
  Half-Life to get a few frags just like the rest of us.  The robe took me forever
  to get working.  The valve standard skeletons and animations were definately
  made for two separate legs, not to be attached at all by a long robe.  The low
  poly count of the robe parts was the only way I could get it to look like it's
  flowing a little and not overlap itself when each leg bends into weird positions.
  The feet are also well outside the skeleton's feet to keep the inner legs from 
  poking through the robe in a few animations.

Last but not least:
  I'd like to give MUCH credit to Brian "EvilBastard" Collins who modeled the
  Punisher, which I used as a scaling basis for Jesus.  I can't for the life of
  me get human proportions right, in drawing or modeling.  I changed the model
  more than enough for it to be called completely different, but once again I 
  thank the EvilBastard for his hard work which made the Second Coming possible.
